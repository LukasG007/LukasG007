- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukasG007 but everyone calls me LUKE
- I'm from Philly! (North east if you really need to know)
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, content creation, internet culture, music technology, and security
- For now I am mostly interested in building cool things that I could use to make YouTube videos/ would make for interesting challenges but in the past I have done hardware design, PCB design, cybersecurity operations (mostly splunk stuff), and a bunch of other stuff too
- Not everything I post on here will be code, I will also post some hardware projects when possible and honestly might just use this as a blog or substack on occasion
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AHK scripting, electrical engineering for scientific instruments, and how to edit youtube videos, and I guess I have kind of specialized in ADC somewhat
- I went to college for ECE and almost got a minor in computational cybersecurity but I was off by 1 credit 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet but if you want to help me do something feel free to message me!
- 📫 If you want to contact me easiest way is #FizWiz3954 on Discord, or come to my twitch stream Monday and Wednesday 6:30 EST at [twitch.tv/LukasG](url)
- 😄 Pronouns: HE/HIM
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked on the beach as a lifeguard for 5 years and I won medals for rowing :)
- (SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE OLD, like 2019 OLD... I WILL LEAVE A DATE WITH THEM BUT GITHUB WILL NOT LET ME PUT THEM UP IN THE PAST SO JUST KNOW A LOT OF THIS STUFF IS ONLY HERE SO I CAN GET IT OFF LOCAL)
