- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukasG007 but you can call me LUKE
- I'm from Philly!
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, twitch streaming, content creation, internet culture, music technology, and security
- For now I am mostly interested in building cool things that I could use to make YouTube videos/ would make for interesting challenges but in the past I have done hardware design, PCB design, cybersecurity operations (mostly splunk stuff), and other stuff too
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AHK scripting, electrical engineering for scientific instruments, and how to edit youtube videos
- I went to college for ECE and almost got a minor in computational cybersecurity but I was off by 1 credit 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet but if you want to help me do something feel free to message me!
- 📫 If you want to contact me easiest way is #FizWiz3954 on Discord, or come to my twitch stream Monday and Wednesday 6:30 EST at [twitch.tv/LukasG](url)
- 😄 Pronouns: HE/HIM
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked on the beach as a lifeguard for 5 years and I won medals for rowing :)
